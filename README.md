# adventofcode2020

I decided to participate in [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/) after seeing a post about it in the [DALI](http://dali.dartmouth.edu/) dev channel!  I thought this would be a great way to learn Python, as well as give me some interesting questions to think about during my winter break!
